# Kaggle exercise application

* Developed a mobile application in Unity for Kegel exercises, which resolves health problem. 
* I used the MVP architectural pattern to separate code blocks and facilitate efficient architecture development, which resulted in creating the prototype in just 4 days.
* Application developed with designer, which created and drawn pictures, icons and entire design for application
* Everything is saving in memory of user (PlayerPrefs)
* Still in development
